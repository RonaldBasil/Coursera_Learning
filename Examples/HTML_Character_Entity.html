<h1>HTML Character Entity References</h1>
<body>
	&quot;I am trying to learn few of the HTML Character Entity References. They are used as an alternative for few of the characters in HTML so that there are no rendering issues. For example: &amp;amp; for &amp;,&amp;gt; for &gt;, and &amp;lt; for &lt;. Also &amp;copy; for &copy;. For putting the text in quotes, &amp;quot;. At times it is required to keep two or more words together despite of the browser/screen getting  shrinked. At that time &amp;nbsp; is used in between the words without any space between them. For Example: These words will stay together despite of the browser getting shrinked-'Always&nbsp;together.'&quot;
